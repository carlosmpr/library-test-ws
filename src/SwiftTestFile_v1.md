  # SwiftTestFile.swift
  ### Code Explanation

This code snippet is written in Swift, a programming language commonly used for iOS and macOS development.

1. **`calculateBMI` Function**:
   - This function calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula `weight / (height * height)`.
   - Parameters:
     - `weight`: The weight of the person in kilograms.
     - `height`: The height of the person in meters.
   - Returns: The calculated BMI as a `Double`.

2. **`getHealthRecommendation` Function**:
   - This function provides a health recommendation based on the calculated BMI.
   - It uses a `switch` statement to determine the recommendation based on different BMI ranges.
   - Returns a `String` recommendation based on the BMI value provided.
   
3. **Usage**:
   - The code initializes weight and height variables.
   - It then calculates the BMI using the `calculateBMI` function and stores it in the `bmi` variable.
   - The `getHealthRecommendation` function is called with the calculated BMI to get a health recommendation stored in the `recommendation` variable.
   - Finally, it prints out the calculated BMI and the health recommendation.

### Example Usage

```swift
let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
```

This code snippet can be used in a health-related application to calculate BMI and provide personalized health recommendations based on the calculated BMI value.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  ///jsx
  import Foundation

func calculateBMI(weight: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return weight / (height * height)
}

func getHealthRecommendation(bmi: Double) -> String {
    switch bmi {
    case ..<18.5:
        return "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
    case 18.5..<24.9:
        return "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
    case 25..<29.9:
        return "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
    default:
        return "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."
    }
}

let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
  ///
  ```
