  # SwiftTestFile.swift
  ### Code Explanation

This code snippet is written in Swift, a programming language commonly used for iOS and macOS development.

#### Functions:
1. `calculateBMI(weight: Double, height: Double) -> Double`: This function calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula `weight / (height * height)`. It takes two parameters, `weight` (in kilograms) and `height` (in meters), and returns a `Double` value representing the BMI.

2. `getHealthRecommendation(bmi: Double) -> String`: This function provides a health recommendation based on the calculated BMI. It uses a `switch` statement to determine the BMI range and returns a corresponding recommendation message. The recommendations vary based on the BMI range.

#### Variables:
- `weight`: Represents the weight of an individual in kilograms.
- `height`: Represents the height of an individual in meters.

#### Example Usage:
```swift
let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
```

#### Output:
```
BMI: 22.86
Recommendation: Normal weight - Keep up the good work!
```

This code snippet calculates the BMI based on the provided weight and height values and then provides a health recommendation based on the calculated BMI. The recommendations range from underweight to obesity, guiding individuals on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  ///jsx
  import Foundation

func calculateBMI(weight: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return weight / (height * height)
}

func getHealthRecommendation(bmi: Double) -> String {
    switch bmi {
    case ..<18.5:
        return "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
    case 18.5..<24.9:
        return "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
    case 25..<29.9:
        return "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
    default:
        return "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."
    }
}

let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
